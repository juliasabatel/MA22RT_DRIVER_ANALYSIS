# MA22RT_DRIVER_ANALYSIS üèé

Driver analysis of the MART FS team during the Formula Student Spain race, last race of the 2021/2022 season.

Endurance is one of the most outstanding Formula Student tests, it consists of a 22km timed race with a mandatory driver change in the middle, so there is an A and B driver.
The analysis of the driver consists of a study of speed, acceleration, brake and RPM through the telemetry obtained in the race. We have data from driver A and driver B.

# WHAT CAN BE DONE üî•

Printing of maps by longitude and latitude, aerial plane, dark, white... filtering by speed, acceleration, brake, RMP, longitudinal accelerations, lateral accelerations...

Comparison of drivers A and B by filtering by maximum, minimum and average values.

The graph of the video above belongs to the acceleration of the driver A, the map is segmented by colors so that both the acceleration and other values such as speed etc. are ordered in red tones the highest values and in greenish tones the lowest values. 

On this map an exact point is taken from the lower graph, so you can see exactly where you are. It can also be done in the opposite way, from an exact point on the map to obtain the speed, acceleration, braking and other values that have previously been collected by the telemetry of the car.

For a more accurate comparison, and to obtain conclusions, drivers A and B have been compared in the same graph in which the green color corresponds to driver A and the purple color to driver B.
The upper graph belongs to the speed, the second to the acceleration and the third belongs to the longitudinal acceleration through which brake has been obtained.
