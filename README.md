# MA22RT_DRIVER_ANALYSIS üèé

Driver analysis of the MART FS team during the Formula Student Spain race, last race of the 2021/2022 season.

Endurance is one of the most outstanding Formula Student tests, it consists of a 22km timed race with a mandatory driver change in the middle, so there is an A and B driver.
The analysis of the driver consists of a study of speed, acceleration, brake and RPM through the telemetry obtained in the race. We have data from driver A and driver B.
